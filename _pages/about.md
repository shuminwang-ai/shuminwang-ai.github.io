This is Shumin Wang, a Ph.D. student at School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, advised by Prof. [Yanyong Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yanyongz/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's Degree at School of Computer Science and Technology, USTC. I am working as an intern at Tongyi Lab, Alibaba Group now.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on expanding the application scope of large-scale neural networks. This includes extending large language models and exploring scaling laws in more modalities. Recently, my research focuses on two topics: Foundation models for 3D vision and Self-improvment for large language models.



News!
======
- 29/11/2024 Our work "Language Adaptation of Large Language Models: An Empirical Study on LLaMA2" is accepted by [COLING 2025](http://coling2025.org)
